# Network Train Simulator (NeTrainSim)

NeTrainSim is an open-source train simulation software that allows users to simulate and analyse train operations on a large rail network. It is designed to be flexible, modular, and easy to use. It is built using Qt6 under the [GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

## Project Moved

As of the latest update, the development of NeTrainSim has been moved to a new repository. The new home for the project is now located at:

**https://github.com/VTTI-CSM/NeTrainSim**

Please visit the new repository for the most up-to-date code, issues, and discussions related to NeTrainSim. We look forward to continuing the development and collaboration in the new repository.

## Features

- **Accessible and affordable**: NeTrainSim is freely accessible to anyone with internet and laptop access, without the need for costly commercial licenses.
    
- **Open-source development**: NeTrainSim is an open-source project, allowing researchers to modify the code and collaborate easily.
    
- **Advanced network modeling**: NeTrainSim can model entire rail networks, including country-scale simulations.
    
- **Versatile and adaptable**: NeTrainSim can be adapted to various rail network types and configurations, providing flexibility in simulations.
    
- **Energy-efficient**: NeTrainSim's Energy Consumption module supports a wide range of train technologies, accommodating future advancements.
    
- **Second-by-second data tracking**: NeTrainSim provides detailed data, including energy consumption, on a second-by-second basis for each train.
    
- **Advanced train dynamics**: NeTrainSim uses advanced train dynamics models, including operator aggressiveness, for accurate energy consumption representation.
    
- **Energy optimization**: NeTrainSim includes an energy optimization module for optimizing individual or grouped trains (under development).
